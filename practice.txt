mP
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
H is move to the top of the buffer

G is move to the last line of buffer
move the text from bottom line to top line is $m0
pA copies everything from the yank to the current buffer
%y a yanks all the text on the current buffer
%d deletes everything on the current buffer

anytime you are on vim you can type :'P to come back here.
to reverse the order of lines is :g/^/m0 read --> help global
:m is move --> ranges are $ is end 0 is start . is current. so in order to move current line to second line :.m2
:h range is your friend
c-R redos the undo .
:so ~/.vimrc is to update the current buffer so it reflects the latest .vimr
